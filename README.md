# Landing Pages

This project contains a few layouts of landing pages that have been rewritten
to make them usable. This was done because testing value propositions is so
much easier when one does not have to spend too much time redesigning pages and
can just fill in the blanks on a layout that people are probably already
familiar with, but even that is just an assumption.

The layouts have been inspired by landing pages that are currently out there
and winning users over :trophy: but **none** of the code has been copied from
the source sites which should steer most clear from plagiarism or copyright 
violations.

## Featured Examples

The following table lists the landing page layouts that are used on some sites
and the template within this repository that remotely mimics that layout.

licensing distractions which is why this is published under the terms of the
