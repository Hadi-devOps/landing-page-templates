# Landing page templates

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

This project contains a few layouts of landing pages that have been rewritten
to make them usable. This was done because testing value propositions is so
much easier when one does not have to spend too much time redesigning pages and
can just fill in the blanks on a layout that people are probably already
familiar with, but even that is just an assumption.

The layouts have been inspired by landing pages that have proved successful in
winning people over :trophy: but **none** of the code has been copied from the
source sites which should steer most clear from plagiarism or copyright
violations.

## Templates

The following table lists the landing page templates that are used on some
sites and the template within this repository that remotely mimics that layout.
