# Landing Strip

This project contains a few layouts of landing pages that have been rewritten 
to make them usable. This was done because A/B testing is so much easier when
one doesn't have to spend too much time redesigning pages and can just fill in
the blanks on a layout that people are probably already familiar with, but even
that is just an assumption. 

The layouts have been inspired by landing pages that are currently out there
and winning users over :trophy: but **none** of the code has been copied from
the source sites which should steer most clear from plagiarism or copyright 
violations.

## Featured Examples

The following table lists the landing page layouts that are used on some sites
and the template within this repository that remotely mimics that layout.
